# API Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Biosero Data Services API. This documentation provides everything you need to integrate with and utilize Biosero's laboratory automation and data management platform.

## What is the Biosero Data Services API?

The Biosero Data Services API is a powerful RESTful interface that enables seamless integration with Biosero's laboratory automation ecosystem. It provides programmatic access to:

- **Laboratory Asset Management** - Track and manage laboratory equipment, containers, and resources
- **Sample and Material Tracking** - Monitor samples, materials, and their locations throughout workflows
- **Event Management** - Access comprehensive audit trails and system events
- **Workflow Orchestration** - Retrieve and manage automated workflow processes
- **Location Services** - Query spatial relationships and container hierarchies
- **Data Analytics** - Access measurement data, parameters, and metadata

## Key Features

### üîç **Comprehensive Querying**
- Real-time access to laboratory data
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Location-based queries and spatial relationships

### üèóÔ∏è **Robust Data Models**
- Strongly-typed data structures
- Consistent parameter handling
- Rich metadata support
- Extensible property collections

### üîí **Enterprise-Ready**
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit trail and event tracking
- RESTful design principles

### üêç **Python SDK**
- Native Python client library
- Type-safe data models
- Context manager support
- Async/await compatibility

## API Architecture

The Biosero Data Services API follows RESTful principles and is organized around key resource types:

- **Identities** - Core objects representing laboratory items
- **Locations** - Spatial positioning and container relationships  
- **Events** - System activities and audit information
- **Workflows** - Process execution and orchestration
- **Measurements** - Quantitative data (volume, weight, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Access to a Biosero Data Services instance
- API credentials and base URL
- Python 3.7+ (for Python SDK usage)

### Quick Start with Python SDK

```python
from biosero.query_client import QueryClient

# Initialize the client
with QueryClient("https://your-api-base-url.com") as client:
    # Get an item's identity
    identity = client.get_identity("sample-123")
    
    # Query items at a location
    items = client.get_items_at_location("freezer-A1", limit=50, offset=0)
    
    # Get materials in a container
    materials = client.get_materials_in_container("plate-456")
```

### Authentication

The API uses standard HTTP authentication mechanisms. Contact your system administrator for:
- API base URL
- Authentication credentials
- Access permissions

## API Versions

The Biosero Data Services API uses semantic versioning:

- **v2.0** - Current stable version for most query operations
- **v3.0** - Latest version with enhanced features for identity management and workflows
