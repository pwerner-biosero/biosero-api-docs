**Execution Agents** are specialized, distributed applications that serve as the operational backbone of the Biosero Orchestrator platform. They interact seamlessly with **GBG Conductor** to execute Python-based laboratory automation actions, fulfilling orders registered in Biosero's Data Services.

## 🎯 Overview

Execution Agents bridge the gap between high-level workflow orchestration and low-level instrument control, enabling:

- **Distributed Processing**: Deploy agents across multiple machines and environments
- **Dynamic Execution**: Run Python-based actions on demand
- **Order Management**: Process workflow orders with automatic status tracking  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently
